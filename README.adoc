= SYCL Embedded Workshop 2022

Welcome! In here you will find all the materials you'll need for the day:

* link:docs/rp2040.pdf[RP2040 reference manual]
* link:docs/pinout.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico Pinout Diagram]

You can build all the demo programs with `zig build`. From there all you need
to do is drag and drop one of the `<demo>.uf2` files into your mass storage
device.

The `build.zig` code is pretty short and hackable, have fun!

== Prerequisites

* we only use zig master in this house
* if you want completions a la ZLS, then go update that to master as well
