//! This example showcases how to use the serial communication component,
//! the UART.
//!
//! UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter,
//! a device that implements a typical serial communication.
//!
//! The RP2040 has two UART components, we're using the UART 0, which can be
//! connected to pins GP0 (TX) and GP1 (RX).
//!
//! Attach a serial adapter to it to receive the data on your PC.
//! NOTE: Don't forget to cross over the wires, the RP2040 TX must be
//! connected to the serial adapter RX, and the RP2040 RX must be connected
//! to the serial adapter TX. Also make sure that the serial adapter is using
//! 3.3V instead of 5V.
//!
//! This example implements a basic echo example, which will return every character
//! you type except for the ascii characters 'Z', 'I' and 'G'.
//! Typing one of these letters will panic the code to showcase the microzig panic handler.
//!
//! Prerequisites: none
//!

        // Note that this isn't the bandwidth of the port, as the baud rate
        // also contains start and stop bits.
        // As we don't configure word_bits, stop_bits and parity, these values
        // will be the standard "8N1" (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
        // This means, our actual transfer rate is:
        // 115200 baud / (8 data bits + 1 start bit + 0 parity bits + 1 stop bit) = 11520 kB/s

    // of 0xFF.
